## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find various machine learning tasks that we've completed during our Data Science bootcamp. These tasks cover a range of topics such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

## Tasks Overview

Below is a brief overview of the machine-learning tasks included in this repository:

1. **Task 1: Classification**
   - Description: Creating a decision tree that can predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
   - Dataset: [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
   - Notebook: `decision_tree_titanic.ipynb`

2. **Task 2: Blog**
   - Description: The Blog Project is a simple web application built using Python and Flask.

3. **Task 3: Image Processing**
   - Description: This project aims to develop a model to recognize and classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. 
   - Dataset: [MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset)
   - Notebook: `mnist_task.ipynb`

4. **Task 4: Clustering**
   - Description: Customer segmentation using K-means clustering.
   - Dataset: [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers)
   - Notebook: `Kmeans_task.ipynb`

 5. **Task 5: Organize downloads**
   - This project automates the organization of files in your Downloads folder by moving them into subfolders based on their file types.
