# Project Name: Country Development Status Determination using Clustering

## Objective

The objective of this project is to group countries based on socio-economic and health factors to determine their development status. This will be achieved using clustering techniques in data analysis.

## Methodology


1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, normalize numerical data, and encode categorical variables if necessary.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Select relevant features (socio-economic and health factors) that will be used for clustering.

3. **Clustering Analysis**:
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering) to group countries based on similarity in socio-economic and health factors.

4. **Interpretation**:
   - Analyze the clusters formed to interpret and determine the development status (e.g., developed, developing, underdeveloped) of each country based on their cluster memberships.
