# Titanic Survival Prediction with Machine Learning

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crew.

In this project, we'll be using the Titanic dataset to train machine learning models that predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `decision_tree_titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `titanic.csv`: Dataset file containing information about Titanic passengers.
- `requirements.txt`: File specifying the Python libraries required to run the code.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required Python libraries.

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook `decision_tree_titanic.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
